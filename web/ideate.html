                                            top-notch jury at this event.It's a unique opportunity to meet and network with industry 
                                            leaders,entrepreneurs, designers, developers, investors, press & media.</h4>
					<p>Have a presentation (a "pitch deck") prepared with which you can pitch your entire idea 
                                            and business plan in less than 20 minutes. You should also be able to provide more details 
                                            if questions arise. Decks should be about 10 pages long.</p><br>
                                        <p>Here, we've listed the 10 components that investors care about the most and how you should 
                                            approach them.</p><br>
                                        
                                            <h4><kbd>Cover Page </kbd></h4>
                                          <p> The cover page should have your logo, business name and a tagline. 
                                            Your tagline should give insight into your company and be easy to remember, 
                                            for example, “We are the Groupon for X." Remember to include your contact 
                                            information — you would be surprised how many people forget it. Especially if 
                                            your deck was forwarded, it should be easy for a person to track you down.</p>
                                          
                                           <h4><kbd>Summary</kbd></h4>
                                          <p>Summarize all of the information before you present it, and use this opportunity 
                                              to get your audience interested in your company. Talk up the most interesting facts 
                                              about your business, as well as any huge milestones you may have hit.</p>
                                          
                                           <h4><kbd>Team</kbd></h4>
                                          <p>Investors are not only putting money toward your idea, they’re investing in your team. 
                                              It’s important they know the people who are going to make the concept successful. 
                                              Make sure to include your background too, and how it relates to your new company. 
                                              Highlight any of your team's successful exits. Investors like to see that you can take 
                                              a company to acquisition.If applicable, emphasize that your team has worked together in 
                                              the past or for a long period of time. It shows you can and like to work together. 
                                              If you have any important advisors, list them, but make sure they know you’re using their name.</p>
                                          
                                        <h4><kbd>Problem</kbd></h4>
                                          <p>You need to be able to explain the problem that your concept is going to solve. 
                                              Further, you need to prove why investors should care about solving it with your product 
                                              or service.</p> 
                                          
                                          <h4><kbd>Solution</kbd></h4>
                                          <p>This is the value proposition you are bringing to the table. It should solve the problem you 
                                              just mentioned. If you have a demo of your product, this is the time to show it. Include any 
                                              case studies to show that your product has worked for existing customers.</p>  
                                          
                                          <h4><kbd>Marketing/Sales</kbd></h4>
                                          <p>You'll want to show the market size for your product. This can include profiles of target 
                                              customers, but be prepared to answer questions about the cost of acquiring these customers.
                                              Not knowing this information is a red flag to investors. If you already have sales, you can 
                                              discuss your growth and forecast future revenue.</p> 
                                          
                                          <h4><kbd>Milestones</kbd></h4>
                                          <p>It is difficult to create financial projections for a startup. If you don’t have a long financial 
                                              history, your forecast is really just an educated guess. Instead, you should present the 
                                              milestones that you've already reached. For instance, include that you acquired 1,000 customers 
                                              by X date, that you have a partnership with company Y, that you signed a major customer or that 
                                              you will be cash flow positive by Q3.</p> 
                                          
                                          <h4><kbd>Competition</kbd></h4>
                                          <p>Every business has competition even if you think you're offering something new and unique. 
                                              List your competition and why your product/service is different from their model.
                                              If your competitors have been acquired, list acquisition prices and who acquired them.</p>
                                          
                                          <h4><kbd>Business Model</kbd></h4>
                                          <p>Every investor wants to get his money back, so it's important to tell them how you plan on generating 
                                              revenue. Show a list of the various revenue streams for your model and the timeline for each of them. 
                                              How will you price your product and what does your competition charge? You should also
                                              discuss the lifetime value of your customer and how you will keep him engaged.</p>
					
                                          <h4><kbd>Financing</kbd></h4>
                                          <p>If you have already raised money, you will want to talk about how much, who invested and what you did with it. 
                                              If you have not raised money yet, talk about what you have accomplished with minimal funding. If you have personally 
                                              funded your startup, make it known. Investors like to see entrepreneurs who have invested 
                                              their own money. If you’re pitching to raise capital, list how much you're looking to 
                                              raise and how you intend to use the funds.</p>
